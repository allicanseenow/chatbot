## Chat box

The app is a representation of the code presented in the book [Socket.IO Real-time Web Application Development](https://www.amazon.com.au/Socket-io-Real-time-Web-Application-Development-ebook/dp/B00B97Y4BY)
However, all the bugs presented in the book should be cleared away and the version of socket.io has been upgraded to version 2.x so that the code might have been changed in some parts in order to ensure the compatibility.

Run the app by:

`nodemon Test_Socket_Doc/Socket.IO_Real-time_Book/express/awesome-chat/app.js`
